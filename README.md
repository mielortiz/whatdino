# What Dino Quiz Game
A simple quiz application built using React with randomize set of dinosaur choices and questions

## Demo
Play it here [WhatDino](https://mielortiz.github.io/whatdino/)

## Story
I specifically made the application for my nephew. He's three years old when I created the quiz and very fond of dinosaurs. He usually asks me to show him pictures of different dinosaurs and that makes him very happy so I tried to create a quiz game for him. Available dinosaurs are mostly seen on Jurassic Park movies. Feel free to let your children play it too!

## Development 
* Created using create-react-app
* Deployed in Github Pages
* Images from [https://dinosaurpictures.org/](https://dinosaurpictures.org/)

## Disclaimer
I am still learning on how to properly develop React application so I will be happy for comments and suggestions.
